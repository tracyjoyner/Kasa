# Responsive User Experience using React - Kasa

# Scenario:
Kasa is recruiting you as a freelance front-end developer to build its new web platform.

They have been in the apartment rental business for private individuals for almost 10 years now. Kasa is one of France’s leading apartment rental companies, with over 500 listings posted every day.

This is the perfect opportunity for you to add a great reference to your freelance portfolio!

The Kasa website was developed over 10 years ago using ASP.NET, with lots of legacy code.

Laura, the CTO, launched a complete redesign to move to a full JavaScript stack with NodeJS on the back-end and React on the front-end. Kasa took this opportunity to request new mockups from its regular freelance designer. A big project for this year!

Your goal: Start the React project and build the application, React components, and React Router routes. You should follow the Figma mockups (responsive design, of course!) and all the information provided below. Please be sure to use high-quality code! 

Backend/data: The back-end developer has not yet been recruited, and this will take longer than expected. So, you’ll have to manage without them for the time being. I’ve extracted the last 20 accommodation listings from this JSON file, which you can use for reference when building the frontend.

Technical constraints: You can find Kasa’s coding guidelines here. When creating React applications, we normally use Create React App, but you can use another bundler if you prefer, like Vite for example.
